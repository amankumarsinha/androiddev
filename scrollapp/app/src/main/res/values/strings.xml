    <string name="textview">A <b>paragraph</b> is a series of related
        sentences developing a central idea, called the topic.
        Try to think about paragraphs in terms of thematic unity:
        a paragraph is a sentence or a group of sentences that supports one central,
        unified idea. Paragraphs add one idea at a time to your broader argument.
